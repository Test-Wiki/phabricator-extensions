# About this repository

These are some customizations for Test Wiki phabricator. These are mostly taken from @wikimedia/phabricator-extensions

# src/customfields
These scripts add links on user profiles to attached MediaWiki and GitHub accounts.

# src/oauth
These scripts add the ability to allow users to sign in using their account on an administrator defined MediaWiki wiki running the OAuth extension. These are based on the @wikimedia versions but have been reworked by @MacFan4000 to use OAuth 2.

# src/policy
These scripts implement the "Protect as security issue" feature as seen on Wikipedia phabricator. There is also a script to add a custom app to the apps list within phabricator.
